# WwiseToolkit

WwiseToolkit consists of three main parts, Wwise SDK, Wwise Unity Integration and WAAPI.

Wwise SDK, Wwise Unity Integration and WAAPI are three different tools, each with different functions and purposes. The following are their contents.

1. Wwise SDK (C++)

The Wwise SDK is an audio engine software development kit for game developers that provides a range of features and APIs that enable developers to achieve high-quality audio effects in their games.The Wwise SDK includes a rich set of audio processing and management features, such as audio event creation, audio track mixing and transitions, application of audio effects, and more. By using the Wwise SDK, developers can easily manage all audio content in the game.

2. Wwise Unity Integration (C#)

Wwise Unity Integration is a Unity engine based plugin for integrating Wwise SDK into Unity projects. It provides a number of tools and features that enable developers to use all the features of the Wwise SDK in Unity.Wwise Unity Integration allows developers to create, edit and manage Wwise audio events in the Unity editor, as well as play, control and modify the parameters of Wwise audio events at runtime. By using Wwise Unity Integration, developers can easily integrate the Wwise audio engine into their Unity games and achieve high-quality audio effects.

3. WAAPI

WAAPI (Wwise Authoring API) is a set of APIs for programmatically interacting with and managing Wwise projects.WAAPI can be used to automate the creation, management and export of audio content, as well as integration with third-party tools. By using WAAPI, developers can easily perform batch processing, automate processes, customize workflows, and more to increase productivity and reduce error rates. WAAPI can be used with the Wwise SDK and Wwise Unity Integration to more easily manage and control audio content in Wwise projects.

In summary, the Wwise SDK, Wwise Unity Integration, and WAAPI are three different tools, each with different functions and uses. Wwise Unity Integration is used to integrate the Wwise SDK into Unity projects to use all the features of the Wwise SDK in Unity; WAAPI is used to programmatically interact with and manage Wwise projects to improve productivity and reduce error rates. Developers can choose to use one or more of these tools depending on their needs.
